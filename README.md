For the movie viewing website project, I designed both an admin page and a display interface. The admin page allows authorized users to manage the movie database by performing CRUD operations such as adding new movies, updating existing entries, and deleting outdated content. On the display interface, users can browse through the available movies, view details such as synopsis, ratings, and cast, and even search for specific titles. The project integrates a sleek and user-friendly design with efficient data management to enhance the movie viewing experience for users.
